# Changelog

This changelog begins with the AeroJudge Device App at v26.1.0.

Earlier release notes are preserved in `CHANGELOG_legacy.md`. Repository
assembly and preserved-history migration details are documented in
`migration/README.md`.

## Unreleased

- Prepared AeroJudge Device App identity, package namespace, Maven coordinates,
  setup documentation, and release automation for the final AeroJudge
  repository.
- Fixed the local Docker image build path so the container runs the packaged
  app as `judge.jar`, matching device runtime behavior.
- Fixed release workflow handoff so non-release pushes do not create failed
  release runs.
